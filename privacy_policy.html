6. Legal Bases (GDPR/UK GDPR); DPDP Grounds; U.S. State Law

6.1 GDPR/UK GDPR Legal Bases:

Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b)) — to provide core features.

Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f)) — security, analytics, personalization, product improvement; balanced against your rights.

Consent (Art. 6(1)(a)) — where required (e.g., certain cookies/SDKs, marketing, sensitive categories).

Legal obligations (Art. 6(1)(c)) — tax, compliance, lawful requests.

Vital interests (Art. 6(1)(d)) — rare safety matters.

6.2 DPDP (India) Legal Grounds:

Consent or legitimate uses as notified by the Central Government, including performance of contract and compliance with law. We implement consent and notice mechanisms consistent with DPDP requirements (e.g., notice of purposes, rights of Data Principals, grievance redressal).

We act as a business for most processing. We disclose practices related to sale/sharing of PI (as defined) and provide opt-out where applicable. For some processing, we act as a service provider/contractor to enterprise customers under separate terms.

7. ETX: Automated Processing, Profiling, and Fairness Disclosures

7.1 About ETX. ETX uses signals (Section 3.6) to generate rankings, recommendations, scores, tags, summaries, and routes (“ETX Outputs”). ETX is decision-assist, not a guarantee of outcomes.
7.2 Human In The Loop. Hiring, engagement, or moderation outcomes generally involve human oversight; however, ranking/curation may be automated.
7.3 Rights Regarding ADM. Where applicable (e.g., GDPR Art. 22), you may request human review, express your point of view, or contest an automated decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects.
7.4 Opt-Out of Certain Profiling. Where available by region and feature, you may opt-out or object to profiling used for targeted ads or certain personalization (may degrade functionality).

measure traffic and campaign performance;

personalize content and ads (where permitted);

detect fraud/abuse.

You can manage web cookies via browser settings and regional consent banners; for SDKs, adjust in-app preferences or device settings (e.g., Limit Ad Tracking/ATT).
