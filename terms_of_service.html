1. Parties; Contract Formation

1.1 Contracting Entity. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding agreement between you (“you” or “User”) and Eqly Internet Private Limited or its applicable affiliate (“Eqly,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). If you access or use the Eqly mobile or web application(s), sites, APIs, ETX systems, or related services (collectively, the “Services”), you accept these Terms. If you do not accept, do not access or use the Services.
1.2 Acceptance on Behalf of an Organization. If you use the Services on behalf of an employer, company, or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind such entity, and “you” includes that entity.
1.3 Supplemental Terms. Some features (e.g., payments, employer verification, ETX, beta features) may be subject to additional terms (“Supplemental Terms”). Supplemental Terms are incorporated by reference; if there is a conflict, Supplemental Terms control for their subject matter.

“Content” means text, images, audio, video, code, metadata, feedback, and other materials uploaded, posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Services.
“Coins/Virtual Items” means any in-app credits, badges, or other non-monetary features.
“ETX” means the Eqly Thinking Engine and related automated evaluation, reasoning-trace capture, analytics, personalization, and decision-assist systems.
